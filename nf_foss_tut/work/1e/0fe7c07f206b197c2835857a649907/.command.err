[2023-03-02 13:15:43.821] [jointLog] [info] Fragment incompatibility prior below threshold.  Incompatible fragments will be ignored.
[2023-03-02 13:15:43.821] [jointLog] [warning] 

NOTE: It appears you are running salmon without the `--validateMappings` option.
Mapping validation can generally improve both the sensitivity and specificity of mapping,
with only a moderate increase in use of computational resources. 
Mapping validation is planned to become a default option (i.e. turned on by default) in
the next release of salmon.
Unless there is a specific reason to do this (e.g. testing on clean simulated data),
`--validateMappings` is generally recommended.
